# Telegram-files-to-Google-Drive-using-Google-App-script

This is just an idea for creating a Bot which can send files to google drive using google app script : 


Dont know it will work or not but some one can make it work , 

the concept is 

we can connect Telegram bot and google Sheets via google app scripts 

and we can able to download telegram files into our own servers , using get file 

in google drive  we can download files into google drive from urls 

so combining this two concepts into one i made this idea , 
instead of downloading the file to the server why dont we can just transfer them into our google drive , 


there is already a bot call @getpubliclink , but it works based on the server and there is delay of half hours which the server needs
to download the files into them and transfer it into google drive , 

so here i want to avoid that transaction time and also this must be a serverless process ,,
